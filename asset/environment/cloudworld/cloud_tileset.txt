Comments:	Uploaded as a work in progress. Each tile is 256x256, but the overall canvas size is subject to change. The bottoms of clouds are solid/opaque to denote walkability. Heights for clouds are specified within the template folder based on height categorized as:

High: H
Medium-High: MH
Medium: M
Medium-Low: ML
Low: L
Flat: F

Flat designates the tile as "ending" on the bottom of the specified tile. Still working out a system for where the clouds will end horizontally. Avoiding making this tileset larger than it needs to be. There will be a flipped version copied to this set for more variation.

Edit:
Added flipped, chnged the total size to 1536x1536 to fit all required tiles.


	Guide for use in tiled--
256x256px tiles size, no spacing.

	Guide for finding the tile you want--
Squares with connecting edges are sorted from top to bottom and left to right as follows: Top to bottom == flat to high == left to right
(Example) I need a tile that connects with a medium-low height on the left edge, and high on the right edge. All tiles in the 3rd COLUMN are medium-low on their left edge. All tiles in the last ROW are high on their right edge. The tile I need is in the 3rd column on the last row.
