Comments:	Uploaded as a work in progress. Each tile is 256x256, but the overall canvas size is subject to change. Heights for clouds are specified within the template folder based on height categorized as:

High: H
Medium-High: MH
Medium: M
Medium-Low: ML
Low: L
Flat: F

Flat designates the tile as "ending" on the bottom of the specified tile. Still working out a system for where the clouds will end horizontally. Avoiding making this tileset larger than it needs to be. There will be a flipped version copied to this set for more variation.
